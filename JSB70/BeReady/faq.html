            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <hr>
            <b>What is influenza (the flu)?</b> Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs.
            <hr>
            <b>How is the flu different from the common cold?</b> The flu typically comes on suddenly and is more severe than the common cold, with symptoms like high fever, body aches, and fatigue.
            <hr>
            <b>Who is at higher risk for flu complications?</b> High-risk groups include older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.
            <hr>
            <b>How effective is the flu vaccine?</b> The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent flu and its complications. Its effectiveness varies each year, but it generally reduces the risk of flu illness by 40-60%.
            <hr>
            <b>Can the flu vaccine give you the flu?</b> No, the flu vaccine cannot cause the flu. It contains inactivated (killed) viruses or a single gene from a flu virus (not the whole virus) to stimulate an immune response.
            <hr>
            <b>When should you get the flu vaccine?</b> It's best to get the flu vaccine before flu season starts, typically from September to November, but getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial.
            <hr>
            <b>What are common side effects of the flu vaccine?</b> Common side effects include soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, low-grade fever, and mild aches. These side effects are usually short-lived and less severe than flu symptoms.
